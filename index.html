      The charts demonstrate statistics about health care coverage in the U.S. The first chart demonstrates coverage by marital status in 2018 and 2019 through percent insured. Between the two years, each category saw less than a percentage point of change. The second chart demonstrates insurance coverage from 2015 to 2019 of people below 100% poverty. The range was from about 82% to about 84%. (Source: <a href="https://www.census.gov/.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a>)
